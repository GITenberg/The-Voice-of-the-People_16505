description: In this 1900 novel, Glasgow examines the effects of the Civil War and
  Reconstruction on Southern life, focusing especially on race, class, and gender
  themes that would continue in her literature. Nicholas Burr, the son of a poor white
  farmer, rises to the governorship of Virginia. Yet his political success, tempered
  by disappointment in love, leads to a tragic outcome.
